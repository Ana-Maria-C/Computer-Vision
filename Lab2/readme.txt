Grayscale to RGB:

Transforming a grayscale image to an RGB image involves duplicating the grayscale intensity values across the three
color channels (Red, Green, and Blue). This conversion can be useful when you need to process or display grayscale
images in environments that expect color images.


OpenCV provides several colormaps, such as:

cv2.COLORMAP_JET
cv2.COLORMAP_HOT
cv2.COLORMAP_SPRING
cv2.COLORMAP_PARULA

A function that use cv2.COLORMAP is in grayscale_to_color:
    - The grayscale image is read using cv2.imread with the cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE flag
    - The cv2.applyColorMap function applies a colormap (like cv2.COLORMAP_SPRING) to the grayscale image.
            This method maps pixel intensities to colors, resulting in a colorful representation of the image.

The cv2.cvtColor function is used to convert the grayscale image to an RGB format.
The conversion code cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR tells OpenCV to convert from a single-channel grayscale image to a three-channel BGR image.


Advantages of Conversion
    1.Compatibility: Some image processing libraries or display frameworks may require RGB images, even if they represent grayscale data.
    2.Further Processing: Converting to RGB allows for additional color-based processing or filtering that may not be applicable
directly to grayscale images.


Limitations
    1.The resulting RGB image will not provide any additional information beyond the original grayscale values.
        All three channels (Red, Green, and Blue) will have the same intensity values, resulting in shades of gray in the RGB image.
    2.This conversion does not add any color information; it merely replicates the grayscale data into three channels.
